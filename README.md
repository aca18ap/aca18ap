- 👋 Hi, I’m @aca18ap
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. Those that fly especially excite me. Those you can reprogram, they motivate me. And music, which is basically programming sound.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Engineering at the University of Sheffield. This includes a wide variety of frameworks and programming languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I find cool, I will give my 110% on
- 📫 How to reach me: albi.pia99@gmail.com
